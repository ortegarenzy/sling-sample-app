# Sling Sample App

A simple application that utilizes the JK app widgets. The structure itself is simple, which only shows a basic login page, where when login button is clicked shows a "dashboard" page. This also shows a way how to navigate within each screens and a way to go back to the login page when logout side menu is clicked.

Things that can be enhance from this sample:

```
- [ ] Don't show login page when user is logged in
- [ ] Create a themed textfield, button for consistency and avoid duplicate code
- [ ] Utilize GuiApplicationContext for theming purposes
```
